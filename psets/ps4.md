**this part is due Nov. 2, before the rest of the problem set!**

**You submit your review to github classroom, but you also send it to the student whom you're reviewing**

At this point, you have all provided an IRB application for your project. Great! Now, it's time to perform a review and feedback on that application using the review criteria provided by the IRB. You will each be assigned someone else's IRB application, and you must provide a review form using the following format. 

0. Your name as the reviewer, and who is being reviewed (one line)
1. Summary of proposal research (one paragraph)
2. Protocol description (three-five paragraphs)
3. Anticipated Risks (two paragraphs, or bullet/itemize list)
4. Mitigation of risks in protocol (two paragraphs) 
5. Acceptable risks not mitigated as part of the protocol (two paragraphs)
6. Requested revisions (two paragraphs, and if none, you should explain why)
7. Determination and justification (one paragraph, explaining non-research, exempt, expedite, full-board)


IMPORTANT: Do not copy and paste the answers from the applicant into your review form. It is your job to interpret and provide analysis on the actually protocol. 

You should submit as the reviewer:
* `review.md` your review of the IRB protocol

If your received any requested changes on your protocol for IRB, as an applicant, you need to show that you took those changes in response, or provide justification for not taking them. 

If you did not receive any requested changes, you should provide a one-paragraph summary of the reviewing process you received and reflections on it. 

You should submit the following:

* `response.md` : enumerated list of items updated following the IRB review or the one paragraph summary if no requested changes.
* `review.md` : The review you received

As we've read in class, people reuse passwords across accounts. As a result, [password breaches](https://www.troyhunt.com/the-legitimisation-of-have-i-been-pwned/) cause major security issues in many cases. For this problem, imagine that you are in charge of IT Security at GW, and that Facebook recently suffered a major password breach. You find plaintext passwords from Facebook on the dark web, and some of the usernames and passwords in that leaked data are the same (or similar to) username-password pairs at GW. Follow the NEAT and SPRUCE guidelines to craft a notification to potentially impacted UChicago users. 

In the github submission, include a file called `answer.md` with the following information:

1. One paragraph describing what details you believe to be most important to communicate, and why.

2. One paragraph describing the decisions you made in designing your breach notification grounded in the NEAT and SPRUCE guidelines discussed in class.

3. A sentence or two describing how this notification will be distributed (over email? etc.) and to whom.

Also include a file called `mockup.pdf` (or `mockup.png` or `mockup.jpg` or etc.) that is an actual mock-up of the breach notification itself. (Make sure it looks nice.)

You should submit two files:

* `analysis.md`: 
 * Write one paragraph describing the general readability and accessibility of these privacy policies. Can it be improved? What is understandable and what is not?
 * Write one paragraph on similarities in these privacy policies, particularly regarding data process and how data is used.
 * Write one paragraph describing any differences between these privacy policies. Can you account for why there may be differences?

Write a first draft of the methodology section for your class project. This should be organized similar to the papers you've read in class. Include details on how your survey instruments were developed, and other clarifying information. In your github submission this should be called `methods.pdf` 

Additionally, you should include exact questions, survey scripts in your submission as separate files. These files should be named appropriately, and you can refer to them directly from your `methods.pdf` if need be.
