# Problem Set 3 (out of 130 points)

DUE: Tuesday Oct. 20 at 11:59pm ET


## Problem 1 (25 points) (individual)

Download the Rockyou, myspace, and hotmail datasets from the Leaked Passwords section of [skull security](https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/Passwords) and compute the following results:

* <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\lambda_{10}" title="\lambda_{10}" />
* <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\lambda_{100}" title="\lambda_{100}" />
* <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\lambda_{1\,000}" title="\lambda_{1\,000}" />
* <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\lambda_{10\,000}" title="\lambda_{10\,000}" />
* <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\lambda_{100\,000}" title="\lambda_{100\,000}" />
* <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\lambda_{1\,000\,000}" title="\lambda_{1\,000\,000}" />
* <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\widetilde{G}_{0.05}" title="\widetilde{G}_{0.05}" />
* <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\widetilde{G}_{0.10}" title="\widetilde{G}_{0.10}" />
* <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\widetilde{G}_{0.15}" title="\widetilde{G}_{0.15}" />
* <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\widetilde{G}_{0.20}" title="\widetilde{G}_{0.20}" />
* <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\widetilde{G}_{0.25}" title="\widetilde{G}_{0.25}" />
* <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\widetilde{G}_{0.50}" title="\widetilde{G}_{0.50}" />
* <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\widetilde{G}_{0.75}" title="\widetilde{G}_{0.75}" />
* <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\widetilde{G}_{0.95}" title="\widetilde{G}_{0.95}" />

Additionally, produce a graph where the x-axis is the number of guesses, and the y-axis is fraction guessed, e.g., <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\lambda_{x}" title="\lambda_{x}" />. Produce a line on the graph for each of the datasets you choose.

You should submit the following files:
* `README.md` : markdown file describing how to run your program
* `results.md` : the results of your computation, be sure to label the datasets you used
* `graph.pdf` : 
* `compute_lambda.[py/c/etc.]` : program/script file to compute the lambda values
* `compute_alpha.[py/c/sh/etc.]` : program/script file to compute the lambda values


## Problem 2 (15 points) (individual)

Sign up for prolific using your personal email address (not your GW) email address.

Once you do so, you should finish the following tasks:

1. Complete the introduction study (this is required by prolific)

2. Go to the "About You" page fill in the Basic demographic variables, the geographic variables, and education.

3. Complete at least two studies advertised under studies.

For submission, you must include two screenshots:

1. A screenshot of the About You page showing you completed the screening questions.

2. A screenshot of the Submissions page show you completed two studies

You should submit the following files:
* `reflections.md` : describe some reflections from participating in these studies and how it may affect how you conduct studies
* `about.png` : screenshot of your completed about you page
* `submit.png` : screenshot of your completed submission page

## Problem 3 (75 points) (groups of 2 -- same as PS2)

Run a study on prolific. To do this, you will need to sign up for a *second* prolific account. This time one of your group members should sign up with your GW email address, and register as a requester. Be sure to read the instructions carefully as there is easy integration with Qualtrics -- which you should have an account on based on PS1. 

Your goal for this problem is to design a 5-minute survey, and you should recruit 20 participants paying each $1.25. Prolific takes a 33% overhead, so the total cost of your survey should be $33.50.  **Be sure to pre-test your survey to verify that it takes ~5 minutes. 

> If this is a financial burden for your group. Please let me know ASAP. 

In the last problem set you developed an interview study about privacy and security in ride-hailing apps, like Uber. In this problem, you should convert your open-ended interview into a *mostly* closed-formed survey that evaluates any theories you developed from your qualitative analysis.Not all questions should be closed --- you should have at least three open-ended responses in your survey.

You should produce a final report with the following sections

1. Abstract (one parka synopsis of the research and the findings)
2. Research Questions/Hypotheses (you should enumerate them but also provide 1-2 paragraphs explanation of how they were developed from PS2)
3. Survey Design (3-4 paragraphs describing the survey and how it matches the RQ's/hypothesis)
4. Results (3 paragraphs per RQ/hypotheses describing how the results --- also be sure to include tables and figures)
5. Conclusions (2-3 paragraphs of what you can conclude from this survey)

You should produce at three figures/tables in your report. 

Further, you may avoid collecting demographic information if participants pre-fill out the *About You* section. But you'll need to download that information separately. 

### A note about ethics

As this study is being conducted for educational purposes and not for generalize knowledge, you do not have to get IRB approval. However, the expectation is that you conduct your study with the same level of care as if you had approval. This includes:

1. Treating all participants ethically and fairly
2. Providing confidentiality linking personal information of participants to data.
3. Informing participants that they are participating in a research project for a class.
4. If deception was used, providing post-procedure information to participants

Additionally, prolific has additional rules for their service which requires researchers to not collect any identifiable information, such as full names and email addresses. 


### What to submit

You should turn in the following

1. `survey.pdf` : A pdf export of your qualtrics study
2. `report.pdf` : A pdf of your research report


## Problem 3 (15 points)

For your class project for the class, generate an annotated bibliography of at least 15 research papers that are related to your paper. No more than 7 of those papers can be articles you've been assigned (either required or additional readings) for the class.

Try and identify articles in reputable venues, such as the same list of conferences and journals from which we've been reading articles in class. My best advice for finding further articles is to use Google scholar, both to look for keywords, but also which articles cite other articles.

Each entry in your annotated bibliography should contain the following information.

1. Full citation of the article, including authors, title, conference/journal, page numbers or volumes (if relevant), and year published.

2. Two sentence description of the article's main findings.

3. One sentence describing how this article relates to your research.

### What to turn in

* `bibliography.md` a markdown file of your annotated bibliography
