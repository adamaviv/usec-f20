# Problem Set 2 (out of 100 points)

DUE: Oct. 6th at 1259pm ET

This is a group assignment in teams of 2. Your teams for each part should be the same.

**USING MaxQDA**: I have procured free MaxQDA licenses for everyone in the class. This is a qualitative analysis tool that will make these tasks much easier and clearer. You should install MaxQDA and reach out to the instructor for a license.


## Problem 1 (30 Points) (groups of 2)

From your PS1 assignment on sending an encrypted email, we now have a set of diary entries of participants (that's you!) experiences using encrypted email. Your tasks is to work with another student in the class to perform open-coding and axial-coding on the diary entries to determine emergent themes about the process and difficulties regarding encrypted email. 

The diary entries are available in the github classroom git repo for this assignment. Once completed You should submit the following items

You must submit the following files:
* `codebook.md` : Your codebook you developed. Use markdown formatting of itemized lists to organize your codebook. Organize your code such that larger, axial codes are the top-order list, and sub-list under describe individual group codes. Both the axial-codes and the codes should have a short description explaining them.
* `themes.md` : Write 3-4 paragraphs on an emergent themes or theories you developed based on the analysis. 

## Problem 2 (70 Points) (groups of 2)

**THIS IS A LARGE ASSIGNMENT --- please plan ahead!**

The past few years have seen a number of privacy controversies related to transportation apps like Uber. For instance, Uber has made the news about [God View mode](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ubers-god-view-was-once-available-to-drivers), the [broad tracking of customers' location data](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/12/uber-should-restore-user-control-location-privacy), and [tracking users after rides have ended](https://consumerist.com/2016/12/07/uber-tracks-you-even-after-your-ride-invasion-of-privacy-or-necessary/), [among other issues](https://www.revealnews.org/blog/why-privacy-advocates-are-worried-about-ubers-security-problems/).

Design a short (no more than 10-minute long) interview study exploring one or more research questions of interest to you in the area of security or privacy related to so-called "ride-sharing" apps. Potential topics include the convenience versus privacy trade-off users perceive; awareness of these controversies; physical security concerns related to driving, or being driven around by, strangers; etc. Your interview should have about 5 questions asked in a semi-structured format, so that you can follow up. 

Turn in a 1 paragraph description of your research question(s), and your interview script, including iterations thereon as you practice the interview.  Include in your script everything you will say to the participant at any point in the interview, such as welcoming them at the beginning or thanking them and telling them the purpose of the study.

As a pilot study, conduct an  interview with **3** participants (and, if applicable, improve your script in between interviews). Using your pilot data, perform open-coding with your group members to develop a code book that you can use as part of your main study. 

For the main study, recruit **6** more participants. These can also be your friends, but of course, for a *real* study, you'd need to recruit strangers. From these interviews, you will have 6 transcripts. 

For both of these studies, you can recruit friends and family. Be sure to indicate that you are doing this for educational purposes and their participation is totally voluntary. While you would not want to have your friends and family participate in a real study, it's perfectly fine to have them participate as part of your class assignment. 

Once you're done with data collection for the main study, use your code book from the pilot study so that each group member independently codes each transcript. It may be the case that new codes emerge during this process, if so, you can share those codes with your partner. When complete, compute a Cohen's Kappa. If your Kappa < 0.6, revisit your codebook and perform updates or discuss how to better apply them. Once done, you can update your coding of the transcripts until you reach a Kappa >=0.6. If your codebook is already have a good Kappa, great! 

Finally, write a short 3-4 page report, that includes a table of your codes and descriptions as well as discussion of the themes identified. Your report should have the following section headers: 
1. abstract (one paragraph synopsis)
2. Research Questions and Methods (3-4 paragraphs): Describe your motivation for the research question, how you designed the interview and any iterations from the transcript.
3. Analysis (3-4 paragraphs): Describe the process of generating the codebook, include the Cohen's Kappa and how many rounds it took to reach agreement.
4. Discussion (4-6 paragraphs): For each theme you identified in your through coding, provide a paragraph or so explaining that theme and a theory for why it was found. 

For the table of the codebook it should have three columns. In the first column, provide a short hand name for the code, e.g., "privacy_concern"; the second column provides a short description of the code; and the third column displays a sample quote that fits that code. 

*Submission*: To submit problem 3 and 4, on github classroom, you should submit the following files: 
* `script-v0.md`: your initial script used before interviews
* `script-v1.md`: your final script used by the end of your interviews as iteration and improvement
* `report.pdf` : the final report based on your interviews



## Tips

Here are some tips and tools you should consider using to complete this assignment:
1. Google Meet has really good transcription tools. I tried out [tactiq](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tactiq-for-google-meet/fggkaccpbmombhnjkjokndojfgagejfb/related?hl=en), which is free for most uses, and could be a good way to conduct your interviews and get a transcript.
2. If you are using transcription, make sure you read your transcript and fix mistakes.
3. You should use the free MaxQDA licences to support your qualitative coding. If that's not your jame, there are also free tools like [Taquette](https://app.taguette.org) to support coding.
4. Don't make this too complicated, focus on a targeted research question and interview. The longer your survey, the more work, but don't be skimpy either. I will review your reports for some depth.
