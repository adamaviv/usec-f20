## Course prerequisites:

There are no pre-requisites for this course. You are expected to have technical background, understand computer science, and can complete minor programming assignments. You should also have reading/writing skills, as course papers and presentations are required. 

## Course Description

Humans are often considered the weakest link in security. A provable secure system is only useful if it can be actually used by users, and system designers need to account for human behavior if they wish to have both security and usability. In this class, we will examine factors of usability of security and privacy though a research-based, project-driven examination. We will cover core areas of security and privacy, as well as cover methods in human interaction (HCI) that can be used to measure the usability of security and privacy. Student are expected to complete problem sets on the topic and complete a research-based project. 

   
## Learning Objectives

1. Read and write critical critiques of scientific papers in the are of security, privacy, and usability.
2. Understand and apply research methods in human factors in computing
3. Develop relevant hypothesis and research questions in the space of usable security and privacy
4. Design and deploy a research study and analyze the results
5. Describe, support, and effectively argue a result using the best practices of scientific writing
6. Understand ethical issues related to human factors research in security and privacy
7. Understanding of the major topics and themes of usable security and privacy

* Presentations: 10%

### CSCI 3907 vs CSCI 6907

CSCI 3907 (undergraduate) is a subset of CSCI 6907 (graduate). Throughout this syllabus, additional requirement of CSCI 6907 students will be noted. Undergraduate students who are dual enrolled must complete the CSCI 6907 requirements.


### Project

This class requires that you complete a semester long research project that should produce workshop-level research results and a written report that is formatted using Latex. 

More details of the project can be found on the [project](project.md) page. 

### Problem Sets

There are five problem sets that require a mixture of programming, writing, and data analysis. Specific directions in the problem sets will be provided. All written work should be typed and submitted via github classroom.

### Readings

#### Research Paper Readings
Each week readings are listed as either *Required* or *Additional*. 

* *All* students are required to read all the *Required Readings* 
* CSCI 3907 must submit **one** Reading Response Form for one of the required readings
* CSCI 6907 must submit **two** Reading Response Forms, one from required readings and one from additional.
* **Readings are due each Wednesday at 12:00pm**

You will submit your reading responses on our class's [HotCRP](https://hotcrp.adamaviv.com/usecf20/) instance by submitting a review from your chosen paper(s). These reviews will be visible to the whole class. The reviewing form is self explanatory. 

#### Textbook Readings

The textbook readings are always required and may be referenced as part of class and assignments. You do not need to provide a reading report, but completing them will enrich your class experience and prepare you for the project. 

### Presentations

Each week, we will have a student presentations of at least one of the *additional* readings, or an approved reading of the student's choice. These presentations should be roughly 20 minutes in length and follow the styles of academic presentations at conferences and workshops. For each session, we will typically have 2 or 3 presentations. 

* CSCI 3907 students must complete **one** presentation throughout the semester
* CSCI 6907 students must complete **two** presentations throughout the semester


## Academic Integrity

The George Washington University has a [Code of Academic Integrity](https://studentconduct.gwu.edu/academic-integrity) which we will follow in this class.  Violations of the code, depending on severity, may lead to any (or all) of the following actions within this class:

* Receiving a 0% on the assignment in which a violation is found
* Dismissal from the course
* Receiving a failing grade in the class

Further action may occur, including referring the case to the Academic Integrity Council for further adjudication.

## Collaboration Policy 

If you have any question about whether some activity would constitute cheating, please feel free to ask. Simply stated, feel free to discuss problems with each other, but do not cheat. It is not worth it, and you will get caught.

### Problem Sets

You may discuss the problem sets with your instructor and fellow students; however, unauthorized assistance must be limited to discussion of the problem, general sketches of approaches. You may *never* share code or solutions, or consulting another students solution is not permitted and constitutes cheating. 

If a problem within a problem set allows group work, you may work together towards a solution; however, each student *must* submit their own copy of the problem set with descriptions in their own words. 

### Readings

You may discuss any readings with any classmate, but your reading response form should be your own work in your own words. Copying a reading response form constitutes cheating. 


### Projects
You are expect to cite and reference all sources used in your project write-up. You should clearly cite any idea that is not your own.

## Ethical and Respectful Behavior

We expect all students to act in an respectful and ethical way, both with respect to the treatment of their peers in the classroom during discussion but also in the design and execution of their course projects. Actions should meet the expectations of ethical research and follow the norms and proper behavior of the George Washington University community.


## Use of Electronic Course Materials and Class Recordings

Students are encouraged to use electronic course materials, including recorded class sessions, for private personal use in connection with their academic program of study. Electronic course materials and recorded class sessions should not be shared or used for non-course related purposes unless express permission has been granted by the instructor. Students who impermissibly share any electronic course materials are subject to discipline under the Student Code of Conduct. Please contact the instructor if you have questions regarding what constitutes permissible or impermissible use of electronic course materials and/or recorded class sessions. Please contact Disability Support Services if you have questions or need assistance in accessing electronic course materials.


## Academic Integrity Code
Academic Integrity is an integral part of the educational process, and GW takes these matters very seriously. Violations of academic integrity occur when students fail to cite research sources properly, engage in unauthorized collaboration, falsify data, and in other ways outlined in the Code of Academic Integrity. Students accused of academic integrity violations should contact the Office of Academic Integrity to learn more about their rights and options in the process. Outcomes can range from failure of assignment to expulsion from the University, including a transcript notation. The Office of Academic Integrity maintains a permanent record of the violation. 

More information is available from the Office of Academic Integrity at studentconduct.gwu.edu/academic-integrity. The University’s “Guide of Academic Integrity in Online Learning Environments” is available at studentconduct.gwu.edu/guide-academic-integrity-online-learning-environments.
